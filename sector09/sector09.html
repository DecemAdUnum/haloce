        <h1 class="text">Welcome to Sector 09</h1>
        <p>
          Today is the last day of your lives, soldiers. <br /><br />Welcome to
          Sector 09, where you will face your inevitable death in the city of
          Mombasa. This ODST-Inspired Firefight will teach you the environment
          and the enemies you will encounter by progressing in difficulty the
          more waves you defeat. No two firefight experiences will ever be the
          same on sector09, as it is designed to randomly spawn waves on a set
          of conditions. <br /><br />This firefight has been in the works for
          four years. I am very excited to give you guys what you have been
          anticipating and waiting for. <br /><br /><br />-Nickster5000

      <h1 style="text-align: center">History of Sector 09</h1>
      <section class="history">
        <ul class="card">
          <h4>2012</h4>
          <li>Firefight Sector 09 was conceived</li>
          <li>
            Massive BSP provided many opportunities, including the idea of
            minigames
          </li>
          <li>
            Unfortunately, the BSP size would prove too large, and would later
            be redesigned several times.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <ul class="card">
          <h4>2014</h4>
          <li>Alpha video is released</li>
          <li>
            New BSP is designed after many issues (Gameplay, Scale, ETC.)
          </li>
          <li>
            However, this new BSP would prove to be too claustrophobic and even
            worse gameplay.
          </li>
          <li>Motivation is very slim</li>
        </ul>
        <ul class="card">
          <h4>2015</h4>
          <li>Polyonymous is formed, with members from VKMT.</li>
          <li>
            Polyonymous attempts to finish Sector 09 as an easy project for the
            young mapping team.
          </li>
          <li>New BSP is designed, which would take stage in CE3 2015</li>
          <li>
            Sector 09 reaches points never achieved before, with the CE3 2015
            trailer.
          </li>
          <li>
            Unfortunately, in October of 2015, Polyonymous breaks up due to
            personal issues, and production on Sector 09 is halted.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <ul class="card">
          <h4>2016</h4>
          <li>
            Nickster5000 draws up, yet again, a new BSP concept and decides to
            model it to see how it looks in Halo CE.
          </li>
          <li>The results of the new BSP are absolutely phenomenal</li>
          <li>
            After new encounters are tested, gameplay proves to be very fun
          </li>
          <li>
            All resources / Efforts are combined from last 4 years of Sector 09
            development into this version.
          </li>
          <li>
            Sector 09 is released during CE3 2016 on 8/20/16
          </li>

      <!--Firefight Information-->
      <h1 style="text-align: center">Firefight Information</h1>
      <section class="firefight-information">
        <p>
          As mentioned previously, this firefight takes a major inspiration from
          halo 3: ODST. It behaves and functions very similar to Halo 3: ODST.
        </p>
        <h4>Firefight Wave Progression</h4>
        <ul class="list">
          <li>5 Waves consist of 1 round</li>
          <li>3 rounds consist of 1 set</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          A very useful tip for you is that the First two sets are on normal
          difficulty. After you begin Set 3 (Wave 31), “Legendary mode”
          activates. When Legendary mode is activated, the firefight is set at
          its most difficult. The pool in which the waves are randomly selected
          has been reduced to the hardest waves in the firefight.
        </p>
        <h4>Ranks</h4>
        <p>
          The more waves you defeat, the higher your rank will be. Here is a
          breakdown of how many waves you must defeat to earn each rank:
        </p>
        <ul class="list">
          <li>Private – Survive wave 1</li>
          <li>Corporal – Survive Wave 5</li>
          <li>Sergeant – Survive Wave 15</li>
          <li>Warrant Officer – Survive Wave 30</li>
          <li>Captain – Survive Wave 60</li>
          <li>General – Survive wave 100</li>
        </ul>
