            Welcome to Sector 09, a Halo 3: ODST themed firefight for Halo
            Custom Edition. You will learn quickly in Sector 09 that there are a
            unique variety of enemies that will attack you at every corner.
            Sector 09 promises that two different firefight experiences will
            ever be the same, as the firefight is designed to spawn waves of
            enemies randomly.

        <section class="firefight-information card">
          <p>
            As mentioned previously, this firefight takes a major inspiration
            from halo 3: ODST. It behaves and functions very similar to Halo 3:
            ODST. Just like in Halo 3: ODST, Five (5) Waves consist of one(1)
            round, and Three(3) rounds consist of one(1) set. The first two sets
            in Sector 09 are considered to be "normal" difficulty. However, once
            you begin Set 3 (Wave 31), "Legendary mode" will activate. This
            guarantees that the firefight will send you the most difficult,
            challenging, and most importantly fun encounters that Sector 09 has
            to offer.

        <section class="history">
          <ul class="card">
            <h4>2012</h4>
            <li>Firefight Sector 09 was conceived</li>
            <li>
              Massive BSP provided many opportunities, including the idea of
              minigames
            </li>
            <li>
              Unfortunately, the BSP size would prove too large, and would later
              be redesigned several times.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <ul class="card">
            <h4>2014</h4>
            <li>Alpha video is released</li>
            <li>
              New BSP is designed after many issues (Gameplay, Scale, ETC.)
            </li>
            <li>
              However, this new BSP would prove to be too claustrophobic and
              even worse gameplay.
            </li>
            <li>Motivation is very slim</li>
          </ul>
          <ul class="card">
            <h4>2015</h4>
            <li>Polyonymous is formed, with members from VKMT.</li>
            <li>
              Polyonymous attempts to finish Sector 09 as an easy project for
              the young mapping team.
            </li>
            <li>New BSP is designed, which would take stage in CE3 2015</li>
            <li>
              Sector 09 reaches points never achieved before, with the CE3 2015
              trailer.
            </li>
            <li>
              Unfortunately, in October of 2015, Polyonymous breaks up due to
              personal issues, and production on Sector 09 is halted.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <ul class="card">
            <h4>2016</h4>
            <li>
              Nickster5000 draws up, yet again, a new BSP concept and decides to
              model it to see how it looks in Halo CE.
            </li>
            <li>The results of the new BSP are absolutely phenomenal</li>
            <li>
              After new encounters are tested, gameplay proves to be very fun
            </li>
            <li>
              All resources / Efforts are combined from last 4 years of Sector
              09 development into this version.
            </li>
            <li>
              Sector 09 is released during CE3 2016 on 8/20/16
