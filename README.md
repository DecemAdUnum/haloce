# Welcome to the Halo Custom Edition Website!

In this project's current state, it represents a simple landing page. This will not necessairly be the case in the future, as Halo Custom Edition has many projects and community members, and I have many ideas for this website.

Some possible additions include:

- Project Pages
- News Section (Keeping the community up to date)
- User Profiles
- User engagement (Comments, Likes, etc.)

If you want to contribute, checkout CONTRIBUTIONS and CODE_OF_CONDUCT.

Thank you for your contribution to the Halo Custom Edition Website!
